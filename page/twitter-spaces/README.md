## Virtual Stammtisch (International) Twitter space

**Where?** [Phylo's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PhyloIota) will host the Twitter spaces, and every Twitter user can join them.

**When?** Every Thursday at 6 pm PST / 9 pm ET

**Who?** Everyone

**How?** You can listen into the Twitter space from a laptop or mobile device. To speak in the space, you NEED to join from a mobile device. Up to 10 people will be able to be speakers. To request speaking rights, just use the internal Twitter function to "raise a hand," One of the space admins will grant you the ability once a slot is available. You can find more Infos in this [excellent guide](https://create.twitter.com/en/articles/how-to/2021/twitter-spaces-how-to-guide)

**Rules?**

  - Whatever is discussed in the Twitter space stays in the Twitter space! 
  - We will never record the space!
  - If an IOTA Foundation member is speaking, the others, please dont interrupt
  - The focus is on topics that are relevant to IOTA / Shimmer / Assembly
  - No political discussions. This just kills the mood.
  - Please dont fall into lengthy monologues. Give room for others to comment and take a break from time to time, so others have the chance to jump into the discussion.
  - Some booze may be okay, but too much will not be a thing we can tolerate
  - Dont fish for ETA's - you won't get it, and it will only annoy the IF members.
