The first test of Bivreost Wallet was quite nice experience.
I only had to save my security words and insert a password and it autmatically created a Shimmer and an IOTA Wallet.
Sending and receiving fund was also very easy. I could even send Shimmer to TanglePay in both directions
Great work so far. Now lets wait until they are audited and the code is open source. Also a Ledger integration is still missing...
